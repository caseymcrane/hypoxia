the body class is basically the heart of how the entire combat system works. it could potentially be overhauled
or refactored into part of the object class, but it seems to be fine as it is now, even if some of the
player.body.limb and limb.owner.organs stuff is a little unwieldy.

basically the way it works is that body is just an abstract container for limbs, organs, blood, and your inventory
it doesn't actually have a position, a char, a color, or any of that stuff. it derives all that stuff from the object
it's attached to, so if you instantiate a body without tying it to an object, it's just kind of an abstract clump of data

the body doesn't even have hp. all of that is delegated to the limbs. one possible change could be giving the body a bool
to determine if it's alive or dead, which could be useful as the way we deal with death evolves.

this is where all the magic happens, as far as combat is concerned. as you can see, it's a very janky proof-of-concept, 
but it mainly works. the constructor is a nightmare but almost all of these properties are optional. below i'll go through 
what they each mean.

hp				the amount of damage this limb can take before its death function is called

name			the name of this limb for both combat log purposes, and severed leg on the ground purposes

strength		how "strong" this limb is. this can be used for a few things, from calculating damage in an attack function to
				determining carrying weight or how easy it is for you to pick up large objects. i.e. it's not just for arms
			
speed			how "fast" this limb is. right now this does absolutely nothing, but i'd like it to determine how fast you can
				move, or how quickly you can deliver a jab or an attack or something
			
organs			these are the parts inside limbs that do stuff. basically, when a limb takes damage, based on the strength of the attack
				and some RNG, the organ(s) can take damage as well. organs are good for you and do important stuff in your body, and if they're
				badly damaged or destroyed, you'll have bigger problems. the main goal is to make hp loss a less linear measure of your health.
				hp represents the absolute limit of what your body parts can take before they are absolutely destroyed, but organ damage will
				be the real killer. organs will comprise obvious things like heart, lungs, brain, etc. but also things like bones. your arm could
				have a bone as its organ, and if that bone breaks, your arm's usability will be pretty well compromised
			
grasp			i couldn't think of a better name for this, but this is basically whatever this limb is holding, which can be anything from an item
				or weapon, to maybe a grapple on an enemy's limb
			
equip			this is basically an equipment slot for armor or clothing or something. maybe this could be made a list, but i don't want someone
				wearing like 5 shirts and 4 pants and 18 pairs of socks, dwarf fortress style
			
grab_function	this is the function the limb will use to grab stuff, both in the sense of picking up items and grappling and anything else.
				it's how an object makes its way into the grasp variable
				
attack_function	this is the function the limb will use to deal damage

take_damage		this dictates how the limb will take damage, how it might proliferate down to the organ level, etc

death_function	this is what happens when you completely lose limb hp, and represents catastrophic structural failure. 
				this is an arm that has been severed or pulverized, a collapsed ribcage, or a caved in skull.

the pathfinding they'll use to get to you, and the general kind of approach they'll take with you, determined by strategy
and balanced by fear.

my ultimate idea is to have every actor make a threat and friendliness assessment of every other actor they see, basically sizing them up and
storing that information, maybe updating it if you pull a weapon or something. their strategy and mindset then dictate what they
do with that once they enter combat. if they're more of a timid type, they might find a friendly with the biggest threat and hide behind them.
maybe some people prey on the weak, and will try to take out low-threat stragglers, and maybe others go straight for the biggest guy in the room

this was my first attempt at writing a helper function to create people. it's very quick and dirty.
due to the limb and organ system, creating and equipping a person requires quite a bit of legwork.
you have to instantiate all your organs and limbs, connect them all together, connect them to a body,
then create an object that's connected to that body.

pretty soon this should be scrapped in favor of a series of helper functions that can build this stuff up
in useful chunks. making a "standard" human should be pretty easy to do.
